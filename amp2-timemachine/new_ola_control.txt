Startup file with a single data line (one set of scene values) causes the
playback process at start to hang indefinitely and not terminate back to
Python / Console. Don't know why, nothing in the docs suggests this.

If you duplicate the line and put a line with `10` on it in between, so the
file specifies the same state twice with a 10 millisecond gap, then all is
well and the playback returns effectively instantly.


# Time Machine

DMX controls two channels of DMX dimmer with the two rope lights on them.
DMX address: 1
Rope lights on channels 1 and 2


## LEDs direct

Can I do something with the three LEDs on the front of the AMP2 just marked
"comms"?

According to the device tree these are GPIO 37 to 39 - works.

GPIO zero LED and LEDBoard have nice Pulse functions but they are linear PWM
values so don't look linear to visual perception. But really small floats
(like 0.01) do work, so we should be able to improve on the law.

Actually, just squaring the brightness (which is range 0-1) makes a large
improvement. Three is also good but starts to introduce a dark period because
we must hit the PWM minimum.
Set to 2.5 as a compromise setting.
Using 2 second on and off time gives a smooth, slow pulsing of the three LEDs
in sequence.

Shifting to 1 second gives a much faster pulse rate for the "travelling"
phase. These can be wrapped round the ola playback to sync the two up, because
ola_recorder blocks whilst playing (but the pulsing is in a separate thread
per LED).

copied new script `lights2.py` to /usr/local/bin/lights.py so it runs on boot. Now just
need some appropriate show files for the two buttons to call up.

## DMX Control

These are OK.olar and F1.olar, which have different flash/pulse sequences.
Created using ola_dmxconsole and then hand editing the files.
Files go in the user home directory on the OS image.

The rest of the system is copied from the Golgotha controller using the same
hardware.
