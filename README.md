pi-play-scripts
===============

Scripts for controlling lighting playback on a Raspberry Pi running
[Open Lighting Architecture](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/).

There are two versions - the original 2014 shell scripts using WiringPi are in the
[gethsemene-shell](./gethsemene-shell/) directory, and a new set written in 2023 using the
[GPIOzero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io) Python library are in the
[amp2-python](./amp2-python/) directory.

These scripts and files are under a CC0 license, in other words in the public domain as far
as permitted by law. You are free to do what you like with them, they are very simple!
